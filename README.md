> A comprehensive approach to integrating diverse API protocols and formats

## Updated: 2025-03-07

## Overview

Modern enterprise systems often need to integrate with multiple APIs that use different protocols, formats, and interaction patterns. This project provides implementations of five complementary integration strategies to address these challenges:

### 1. Adaptation Layer

The Adaptation Layer translates between different API protocols, allowing clients using one protocol (e.g., REST) to communicate with services using another protocol (e.g., GraphQL or SOAP).

**Key Features:**
- Protocol translation and request/response mapping
- Support for REST, GraphQL, SOAP, and other protocols
- Configurable transformation rules

### 2. Microservices with API Facades

This approach implements microservices with multiple API facades, allowing the same underlying service to be exposed through different interface styles.

**Key Features:**
- Decoupled external API interfaces from internal implementations
- Support for multiple parallel interfaces (REST, GraphQL, gRPC)
- Unified business logic with interface-specific adaptations

### 3. Transformation Framework

The Transformation Framework provides a systematic way to define rules for transforming between different data formats and protocols.

**Key Features:**
- Declarative transformation rule language
- Support for complex mappings and transformations
- Bidirectional transformation capabilities

### 4. Metadata-Driven Approach

This approach uses metadata definitions to dynamically generate API endpoints, enabling rapid API development and consistency.

**Key Features:**
- API definition through metadata (YAML, JSON)
- Dynamic endpoint generation at runtime
- Multiple API styles from the same metadata

### 5. API Orchestration System

The API Orchestration System combines multiple API calls into unified interfaces, simplifying complex workflows and reducing client-side complexity.

**Key Features:**
- Workflow definition for sequencing API calls
- Data transformation between steps
- Error handling and compensation strategies
